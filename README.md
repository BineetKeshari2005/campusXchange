# CampusXchange - A Campus Marketplace for Students

##  Project Proposal 

### 1. **Project Title**

**CampusXchange** – A Campus Marketplace for Students

---

### 2. **Problem Statement**

Many university students struggle to find affordable study materials, second-hand electronics, and other essential academic resources.
Students who want to sell or exchange their used items lack a secure and campus-specific platform to reach interested buyers.
Broader marketplaces like OLX or Facebook Marketplace allow external users, reduce trust, and are not built for campus needs.

---

### 3. **Proposed Solution**

CampusXchange will be a full‑stack web platform designed exclusively for campus communities. Students can buy, sell, or exchange used books, electronics, and notes.
The platform will include:

* Secure JWT‑based authentication
* User role management (Student)
* CRUD operations via RESTful APIs
* Campus‑specific listings with search, filter, and sorting
* Pagination for performance and smoother browsing

---

### 4. **Objectives**

* Allow students to **create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)** item listings.
* Implement **secure JWT authentication** for users and admins.
* Provide **advanced search, sorting, filtering, and pagination** for item listings.
* Support dynamic data fetching across pages using APIs.
* Include **wishlist** and **notification** features.

**Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
