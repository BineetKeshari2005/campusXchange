# CampusXchange - A Campus Marketplace for Students

##  Project Proposal 

### 1. **Project Title**

**CampusXchange** – A Campus Marketplace for Students

---

### 2. **Problem Statement**

Many university students struggle to find affordable study materials, second-hand electronics, and other essential academic resources. Students who want to sell or exchange their used items lack a secure and campus-specific platform to reach interested buyers. Broader marketplaces like OLX or Facebook Marketplace allow external users, reduce trust, and are not built for campus needs. There is also no safe way for students to chat and complete payments inside a campus-only system.

---

### 3. **Proposed Solution**

CampusXchange is a real-time, payment-enabled full-stack web platform designed exclusively for campus communities. Students can buy, sell, or exchange used books, electronics, and notes. The platform includes:

* Secure JWT-based authentication
* Real-time buyer–seller chat using Socket.IO
* Razorpay payment gateway integration
* Automated payment verification and order management
* Dedicated buyer and seller dashboards
* Campus-specific listings with search, filter, and sorting
* Pagination for performance and smoother browsing
* Wishlist and saved listings functionality



---
